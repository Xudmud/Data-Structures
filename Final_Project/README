/-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|	Description of the program
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Final Project. Creates binary search trees to hold Actor and Picture objects
	read in from a file, and can search, sort, add/delete/modify entries, and
	print either the trees or search results to a file.

|	Source Files
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	
	BSTreeActor.h
		Contains the member variables and functions for a binary search tree of
		Actor nodes.  Functions include searching, reading in input, and
		printing.

	BSTreeActor.cpp
		Contains the implementations of the member functions in BSTreeActor.h
	
	NodeActor.h
		Contains the member variables and functions for a node of type Actor in
		a binary search tree.

	ActorActress.h
		Contains the member variables and constructor for an Actor object,
		overloaded equality operator, and search functions.

	ActorActress.cpp
		Contains the implementations for the equality operator and search
		functions.

	ActorFunctions.h
		Contains the functions used when working with Actor objects. These
		functions may not necessarily need access to all the member data of
		NodeActor or BSTreeActor.

	ActorFunctions.cpp
		Contains the implementations of the functions in ActorFunctions.h

	BSTreePicture.h
		Contains the member variables and functions for a binary search tree of
		Picture nodes.

	BSTreePicture.cpp
		Contains the implementations of the functions in BSTreePicture.cpp

	NodePicture.h
		Contains the member variables and functions for a node of type Picture
		in a binary search tree

	Picture.h
		Contains the member variables and constructor for a Picture object,
		overloaded equality operator, and search functions.

	Picture.cpp
		Contains the implementations for the equality operator and search
		functions.

	PictureFunctions.h
		Contains the functions used when working with Picture objects.

	PictureFunctions.cpp
		Contains the implementations of the functions in PictureFunctions.h

	MenuFunctions.h
		Contains the functions for most of the menus used by the program.

	MenuFunctions.cpp
		Contains the implementations for the functions in MenuFunctions.h

	main.cpp
		Main program file, calls the main menu to run the program.
