|	Description of the program
\-----------------------------------------------------

Program reads vehicle data from a file vehiclein.txt, creating
a vector of Vehicle objects with make, model, and year.

Program prompts the user for searching either by make, model, or year.

Program will sort the objects based on what is being searched, then prompt
for input. Finally, it will ask if the search should be recursive or iterative.

Program will then perform either a recursive or iterative search for the given search
term.  It will print the first result found, or indicate that there were no results found.

|	Source Files
\------------------------------------------------------

Vehicle.h
	Header file for the Vehicle class.
Vehicle.cpp
	Implementation file for functions in Vehicle class. Contains the constructors for Vehicle objects, 
	member function declarations for comparing the values between the vector objects, and an
	overloaded output operator to print an object of type Vehicle.
Recursive.h
	Header file for the Recursive class.
Recursive.cpp
	Implementation file for functions in Recursive class. Contains overloaded functions for finding
	a specific vehicle model, make, or year; either recursively or iteratively. In both cases, the
	first instance of a match will return the index of that result.
main.cpp
	Main program file. Contains functions to read from the input file and create the vector of vehicles.
	Contains functions for sorting and searching based on user input, and printing the result using
	the overloaded output operator.

cd into the extracted directory.
	$ cd WicklundHW3

Make sure vehiclein.txt is in the same folder as the source files.

Run the makefile.
	$ make

Run the program
	$ ./vehicles

|	Other Thoughts and Notes
\------------------------------------------------------

I was reminded through this homework not to indclude a header
file in a friend class, since the friend declration implies
inclusion.

I saw the instructor response that we should be using the .compare function
for string comparison. I was able to use simple < and > comparisons on strings to
compare, since they're using the string library and not c-strings
