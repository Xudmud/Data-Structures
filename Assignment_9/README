|	Description of the program
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Basic spell checker program. Will read in a given dictionary file,
	build a hash table with 1373 buckets, and then use that hash table to
	spell check a given text file. This text file has all punctuation (save for
	apostrophes) stripped and all words converted to lowercase before being
	checked. 
	The list of misspelled words, along with a count of the words in the
	dictionary and input text file, and the number of misspelled words are
	output to a results_<inputFilename> text file.  The file may or may not end
	in .txt	depending on the input filename (since Linux/Unix doesn't really
	care about extensions, at least for text-based files).

|	Source Files
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	hash.h
		Contains the variables and member function declarations for the hash 
		object. Creates a hash table of 1373 entries. Functions include adding
		to the hash and	checking the spelling of a word.

	hash.cpp
		Contains the implementations for the hash member functions.

	functions.h
		Contains the function declarations for generating a hash, stripping
		punctuation, and converting to lowercase. These are separate from the
		hash class since they get called both when geneating the hash and
		checking against it.

	functions.cpp
		Contains the implementations for the functions in functions.h

	main.cpp
		Main program file.
